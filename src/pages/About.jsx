        About Italica
      </h1>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Italica was created with one purpose: bring the warmth, passion, and
        soul of true Italian cooking to the streets of Lebanon. We’re not
        reinventing Italian food — we’re preserving it. The real stuff. The kind
        passed from nonna to mother to son, cooked slowly, shared loudly, and
        loved deeply.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Our journey began in Beirut, where a love for Italian flavors collided
        with Lebanese hospitality. The result? A cozy meeting point between two
        cultures that adore good food, generous tables, and family-style
        gatherings. Italica blends traditional Italian recipes with the energy
        and warmth that Lebanese dining is famous for.

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        From wood-fired pizzas to homemade pastas, fresh sauces, and aromatic
        herbs, every dish at Italica is crafted with the same dedication found
        in kitchens across Naples, Rome, and Florence. We source fresh local
        ingredients, use classic Italian techniques, and add our own Lebanese
        personality to make every plate unforgettable.
